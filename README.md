# CS350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
-The module three milestone required the use of CCS and the TI LaunchPad to create a program that would flash two messages in Morse code on the LED lights on the board, and change the message by the push of a button.
-The main project for this course used the same resources to create a working thermostat that could be adjusted by use of the buttons.

What did you do particularly well?
-The code for both of these projects is some of the most organized, modularized code I have used thus far in my program. I am most proud of the organization and structure of the written code.

Where could you improve?
-I could not get the final project to build on my machine, and was unable to resolve the issue.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
-I had never used CCS before this class and enjoyed working with it. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
-Being familiar with how embedded systems work and how to use CCS will be greatly beneficial in my future career. I was also able to strengthen my skills in writing in C++, which is now my strongest langueage.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- By creating simple functions that can be reused throughout the code
- Making the code iterate through the number of tasks, tasks can be added on as needed and the code adjusted
- The organized stucture and commented code make it readable to anyone else that might look at it.
